<h3>Version 1.1 (05/04/2010)</h3>
<p>New features in this version include the ability to replace Windows Explorer 
for all folders (only for Vista and Windows 7), and the ability to go up one 
level by double clicking in a tabs whitespace.<br>
<br>
The major changes for this release, however, centre around drag &amp; drop. For 
example, it is now possible to drag and drop attachments from a program such as 
Outlook, as well as drop text from the address bar of a web browser. Both the 
listview and treeview now make use of the same drag and &amp; drop code (the copy 
and paste system also uses this code), meaning the listview and treeview will 
both support the same drop formats. These formats will also be supported via 
copy and paste.<br>
<br>
There have also been a few important changes to the treeview. For instance, 
icons are gathered in a background thread, which should reduce load times 
slightly. Furthermore, all treeview items are now sorted correctly. Even though 
items now have to be sorted, there shouldn't be any performance hit. Expanding 
the C:\Windows\winsxs folder in the treeview (which has ~10,000 folders in my 
system) takes about ~3 seconds.</p>
