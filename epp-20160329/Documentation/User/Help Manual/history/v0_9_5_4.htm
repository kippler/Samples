  <li>If file extensions were hidden, and a filename started with a dot, no text 
  would be shown for that item.</li>

  Explorer++</b> as well, regardless of settings. Fixed.</li>

  drives toolbar.</li>
  <li>If a cd/dvd was inserted/removed, the entire drive would be added/removed, 
  even though the physical device had not changed. Fixed.</li>
  <li>Files are now sorted using natural sort order (e.g. file2.txt comes before 
  file19.txt).</li>
  <li>If the folders pane had focus, and an item was selected, the file 
  associated menus (such as properties) would be disabled incorrectly. Fixed.</li>

  Fixed.</li>

  date format.</li>

  various views, rather than showing the drop-down menu.</li>

  over a tab, and focus is switched to that tab.</li>
  <li>There is now a confirmation dialog shown when deleting a bookmark.</li>

  to a default value.</li>
</ul>
